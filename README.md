## ðŸ¤· What is it?

**Quick tl;dr:**

Collegiate High School's Tech Club hosted a game development competition (2019). The game was to be made in Python using the Pygame library. This is my project for the competition. It is far from a complete game. It mainly serves as a demo for what Tech Club does.

#### Game Details:

This game is essentially just a simple capture the flag game. The window is split in half, each player getting their own half. Each player has their own base with a "flag" (satellite) tethered to it. The goal is to capture the opponent's satellite and bring it to your own base.
